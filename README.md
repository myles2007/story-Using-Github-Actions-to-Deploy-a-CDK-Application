# Welcome
This project is intended to be used alongside my Medium story titled: Using Github Actions to Deploy a CDK Application.

The project structure is reflective of `cdk init app --languge=typescript` and defines two primary things:

 - An OIDC Provider in IAM which will permit GitHub Actions to assume a specific role.
 - A simple Lambda function which will be deployed as an example.

Please see my article as a guide for using the contents of this repository.
